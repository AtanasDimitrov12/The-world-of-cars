          <p class="random-text">For decades, the BRABUS Rocket has proven the undeniable power of our DNA in action. It’s a legacy. A Masterpiece and a quintessential supercar capable of exploring the absolute maximum of what can be achieved through modern performance engineering - reaching cosmic heights and turning the seemingly impossible into reality. From shattered world top-speed records to an unmistakable signature look that has stood the test of time, fine-tuned by several generations – every BRABUS product carrying the Rocket badge represents the highest level. Each more powerful than the last, mastering every single frontier of design and performance in typical BRABUS fashion. Except for one.

            Where can we take it from here? A question that fans and customers around the world have asked us again and again finally has an answer: 1.000 horsepower. For the first time in our history, we present a BRABUS Rocket with four-digit performance figures, specially developed to explore the final frontier. It’s bold. It’s out of this world. It’s the most powerful chapter of the BRABUS Rocket legacy to date and a 1-Second-Wow effect that defies convention. Based on the Mercedes-AMG GT 63 S E Performance, the BRABUS Rocket 1000 has the power to travel endlessly across the stratosphere – combining the breathtaking feeling of zero gravity with bespoke Masterpiece elegance in an entirely new superlative. Production will be limited to 25 units worldwide.</p> <!-- Random text will appear here -->
